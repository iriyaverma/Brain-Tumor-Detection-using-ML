Project focused on Brain Tumor Detection and Classification. The aim is to discern the superior approach between the two methodologies.[CNN and VGG16]

The Brain Tumor Detection Project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to automatically detect the presence of brain tumors in MRI images. Early detection of brain tumors is crucial for timely treatment and improved patient outcomes. By automating the detection process, this project seeks to assist medical professionals in diagnosing brain tumors more accurately and efficiently.

Features:
Automatic detection of brain tumors in MRI images.
Classification of brain tumor types (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary, notumor) based on image data.
Visualization of model predictions and diagnostic results.
Integration with existing medical imaging systems for seamless integration into clinical workflows.
